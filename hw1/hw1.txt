hw1: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/schedule.html (easy)

At the end you should have made a new repo (named what ever, my15122) that contains your hw1 code pushed into any branch, that is then pushed into the branch 'master'. 

Git is a SCM = Source Code Management 

Coding is important but also knowing code management tool is very import. Especially when your code base becomes larger and you work with others.

Send me the link to the github repo with hw1. Also answer this question: 

a. Whats wrong with this code? b. How to fix it.
fav_number = input("type in your favorite number and press enter: ")
print("Your favorite number plus 2 is: ", fav_number + 2)
